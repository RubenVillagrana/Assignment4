  </body><h1>The Big Move to the U.S.</h1>
  p>My father was followed to the U.S. by two of his brothers and one sister. They trusted my father and followed him to the U.S. because he had moved his family from the Huicholas to the Guadalajara.
               He had shown his siblings that if he could do it, anyone of them could do it too. He worked as a farm laborour and a cement finisher for forty-five years.
               He worked from sun up until sundown and I never heard the man complain</P>

                <h1>The American Dream</h1>
                <p>My father was able to purchase a house here in the U.S. and Guadalajara. He was able to buy a few brand new cars in his lifetime and instilled a work ethic that has always made me want more.
                <p>I have worked for the State of California for 22 years and have been able to provide for my family the way he did for my sister and I. 
                I am lucky I still have my father and ask for life advice and lean on him during diffuclt times.</p>

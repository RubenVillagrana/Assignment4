    <p>My father was able to purchase a house here in the U.S. and Guadalajara. He was able to buy a few brand new cars in his lifetime and instilled a work ethic that has always made me want more.
    <p>I have worked for the State of California for 22 years and have been able to provide for my family the way he did for my sister and I. 
     I am lucky I still have my father and ask for life advice and lean on him during diffuclt times.</p>

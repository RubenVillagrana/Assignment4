 <h1>Wanting more out of life</h1>
            <p>My father who at 13 years of age left the indiginous mountain range he called home and set to bring his mother and siblings to Guadalajara Jalisco five years later.
            My father stated he had nothing to lose since he was poor and hungy. He set off to the mexican state of Nayarit. He started working as a labour hand for a masonry and cement company and learned the trade.
            By 18 years old he had saved enough money and moved his entire family to Guadalajara Jalisco.</p>

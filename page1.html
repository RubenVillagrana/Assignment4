Las Huicholas is a rural part of Mexico, only known to the indigenous people who were born and raised and for the most part never leave.  
There was no electricity and the water was brought up from the river to the house in bule, also known as a gourd seed.The language spoken was an aztecan language called Wixarika. 
My father and his seven siblings were taught arithmatic, reading and writing in spanish by my grandfather Ricardo. My grandfather knew that teaching his kids the spanish language would be benifical to them as they grew older.</p>

My father was followed to the U.S. by two of his brothers and one sister. They trusted my father and followed him to the U.S. because he had moved his family from the Huicholas to the Guadalajara.
He had shown his siblings that if he could do it, anyone of them could do it too.
He worked as a farm laborour and a cement finisher for forty-five years.
He worked from sun up until sundown and I never heard the man complain.

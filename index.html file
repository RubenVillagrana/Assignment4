    <h1>Tribute\Biography Webpage</h1>
    </main>The man worked form sun up until sundown as a farm labouror and cement finisher for fortyfive years. It's not until I grew older that I was able to speak to my father and gain insight on why he was so tough and demanding while I was a child and young man.

            <h1>Growing up in the Huicholas</h1>
            <p>Las Huicholas is a rural part of Mexico, only known to the indigenous people who were born and raised and for the most part never leave.  
            There was no electricity and the water was brought up from the river to the house in bule, also known as a gourd seed.The language spoken was an aztecan language called Wixarika. 
            My father and his seven siblings were taught arithmatic, reading and writing in spanish by my grandfather Ricardo. My grandfather knew that teaching his kids the spanish language would be benifical to them as they grew older.</p>

            <h1>Wanting more out of life</h1>
            <p>My father who at 13 years of age left the indiginous mountain range he called home and set to bring his mother and siblings to Guadalajara Jalisco five years later.
            My father stated he had nothing to lose since he was poor and hungy. He set off to the mexican state of Nayarit. He started working as a labour hand for a masonry and cement company and learned the trade.
            By 18 years old he had saved enough money and moved his entire family to Guadalajara Jalisco.</p>

              <h1>The Big City</h1>
              <p>My father had only heard of cars but didn't see one until he was 13 and moved away from home. By the time he moved his family to Guadalajara, they had not seen running water or electricity in a home
              They had seen their first car in the city and never thought they would be able to drive. My father surprised them because he knew how to drive. 
              The second surprised came when he informed his family he was moving to the US and who ever wanted to join him could join him</p>

               <h1>The Big Move to the U.S.</h1>
               <p>My father was followed to the U.S. by two of his brothers and one sister. They trusted my father and followed him to the U.S. because he had moved his family from the Huicholas to the Guadalajara.
               He had shown his siblings that if he could do it, anyone of them could do it too. He worked as a farm laborour and a cement finisher for forty-five years.
               He worked from sun up until sundown and I never heard the man complain</P>

                <h1>The American Dream</h1>
                <p>My father was able to purchase a house here in the U.S. and Guadalajara. He was able to buy a few brand new cars in his lifetime and instilled a work ethic that has always made me want more.
                <p>I have worked for the State of California for 22 years and have been able to provide for my family the way he did for my sister and I. 
                I am lucky I still have my father and ask for life advice and lean on him during diffuclt times.</p>

My father had only heard of cars but didn't see one until he was 13 and moved away from home. By the time he moved his family to Guadalajara, they had not seen running water or electricity in a home
They had seen their first car in the city and never thought they would be able to drive. My father surprised them because he knew how to drive. 
The second surprised came when he informed his family he was moving to the US and welcomed any of his siblings on his journey.
